# Exploratory-Data-Analysis(EDA)-Class

This is an EDA class that can be used to more easily for the following things:
- Vizualize Data
- Keep track of important information regarding data
- Handle null values
- Scale numeric values
- Encode categorical values

If you would like to add on to the class, then do so by all means.
If you run into any issues while using the class, then create an issue

Note: Although this is a relatively simple EDA class, it was designed to be a mini-library of sorts. I might change my mind in the future and add on to this to make it an official library, but for now, this will just stay a personal project.
